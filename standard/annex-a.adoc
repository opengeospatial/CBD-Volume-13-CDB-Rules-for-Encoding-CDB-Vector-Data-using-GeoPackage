== Conformance Class Abstract Test Suite (Normative)

=== Conformance Test Class: OGC CDB Core Standard

This section describes conformance tests for the the optional extension to the CDB standard for structuring and storing any vector data as a GeoPackage container. These abstract test cases describe the conformance criteria for verifying the structure and content of any data store or database claiming conformance to the CDB 1.2 standard.

The conformance class base id is “http://www.opengis.net/spec/cdb/1.2/” and all of the other conformance tests URLs are created in this path. Each conformace class then appends: "/conf/cdb-core/geopackage" to this base ID. Another issue that the reader should pay attention to is the test method. When the test method is assigned with “Visual”, it means that the purpose of the test should be “visually” investigate the file contents, image, or other content.

==== Only one vector data encoding/format per version.

The following conformance class verifies that each "version" in a CDB data store contains one and only one vector encoding/format.
