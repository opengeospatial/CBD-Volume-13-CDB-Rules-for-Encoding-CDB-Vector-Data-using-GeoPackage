 Although the above are guidelines, GeoPackage readers _SHALL_ handle the following cases with proper error handling 
 and reporting for Polygon geometries:

 * Has no self-intersections or co-linear segments

 * Has no identical consecutive points (no zero-length segments)

 * Does not degenerate into zero-area parts

 * Does not have clock-wise inner rings (“Dirty Polygon”) {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}
