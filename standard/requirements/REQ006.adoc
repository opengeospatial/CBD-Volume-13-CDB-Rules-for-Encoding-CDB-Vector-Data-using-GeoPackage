|*Requirement 6* GeoPackage polygon readers {set:cellbgcolor:#CACCCE}

GeoPackage readers _SHALL_ handle the following cases with proper error handling and reporting for Polygon geometries:

 * Has no self-intersections or co-linear segments

 * Has no identical consecutive points (no zero-length segments)

 * Does not degenerate into zero-area parts

 * Does not have clock-wise inner rings (“Dirty Polygon”) {set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}

NOTE: This requirement may change in a future version. These cases may be handled as rules for data prepration.
