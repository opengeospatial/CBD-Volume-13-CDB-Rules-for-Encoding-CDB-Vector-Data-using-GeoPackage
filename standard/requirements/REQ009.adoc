For positive LODs, each Tile-LOD of a GeoPackage vector dataset _SHALL_ have no more than 16,384 points to describe the features, whether the file contains point, lineal, or polygon features.  For negative LODs, this limit SHALL be recursively divided by 4 until it reaches the value 1. This is the same as Requirement 64 in the core CDB standard.
