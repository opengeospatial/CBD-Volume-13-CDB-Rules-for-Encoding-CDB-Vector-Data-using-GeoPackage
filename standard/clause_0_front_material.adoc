[big]*i.     Abstract*

This optional OGC CDB extension defines the requirements and provides CDB specific guidance on using GeoPackage containers in a CDB data store. There is a companion CDB Best Practice document that provide rules and guidance for transforming CDB structured Shapefiles into CDB structure GeoPackages that are compliant with the requirements and conformance classes as defined in this document.

*Background for this optional CDB Extension*

The original requirement for this optional CDB extension was documented in http://ogc.standardstracker.org/show_request.cgi?id=545[OGC Change Request 545]. This OGC change request was submitted based on work performed in http://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/17-042.html[OGC Testbed 13]. The testbed activity and related change request captured a broad community requirement for being able to use GeoPackage containers in a CDB data store. At the same time, an additional requirement was identified to test and identify best practices for moving CDB vector files stored as Shapefiles into one or more GeoPackages.

In 2019, the CDB SWG executed the https://docs.opengeospatial.org/per/19-007.html[CDB Vector Data in GeoPackage Interoperability Experiment (IE)]. The participants in this IE tested transforming CDB Shapefile vector data into one or more GeoPackage(s) and storing the result in a CDB data store. GeoPackage Version 1.2 and CDB Version 1.1 and related Best Practices were the standards baseline used for this experiment. The IE built on the work described in the https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=82553[OGC CDB, Leveraging the GeoPackage Discussion Paper]. A primary objective of the IE was to agree and document possible change requests and/or best practices for storing vector data in a CDB data using encodings and/or containers other than Shapefiles.
