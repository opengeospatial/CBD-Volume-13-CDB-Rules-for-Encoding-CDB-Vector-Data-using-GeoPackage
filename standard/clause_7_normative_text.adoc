== Requirements for Using GeoPackages in a CDB Data Store
This section documents the mandatory requirements for having GeoPackage containers in a structured CDB data store. Many of the requirements are _by reference_ to specific requirements in both the GeoPackage and CDB standards. The referenced requirements are known as _dependent_ requirements. For example, the GeoPackage standrds specifies that any valid GeoPackage shall have a file extension of .gpkg. The optional CDB GeoPackage extension specifies the same requirement.

=== Requirement that one and only vector format can be in a CDB version
The following requirement clearly states that any given version has only one allowed vector format. Currently, the two supported formats are the traditional Shapefiles and now GeoPackages. However, a CDB data store may have multiple versions. Therefore, the Shapefile format could be used in one version and GeoPackages used in another version.

There is a related CDB recommendation that a feature should not have two representations.

<Insert recommendation include here. Page 230>

=== Requirement on geometry types and feature instances
The following requirement clarifies the geometry types allowed for instances of feature data referenced to a tile. Essentially, all instances of a specific feature type (code?) SHALL be of the same geometry type.

=== GeoPackage Requirements
This section defines the GeoPackage requirements that need to be considered when implementing a CDB compliant GeoPackage for use in a CDB data store. This section also provides any clarifications and/or profiles of those requirements.

==== GeoPackage Requirements - core
The following requirement captures all of the core GeoPackage requirements that need to be implemented in order to be a fully compliant GeoPackage for use in a CDB data store. Please note that GeoPackage Requirements 10 and 11 on Coordiante Reference Systems has been profiled to be consistent with the mandatory requirements in the CDB standard.

include::requirements/REQ003.adoc[]

==== GeoPackage Requirements constrained by CDB - CRS Profile
The following requirement clarifies (profiles) GeoPackage requirements 10 and 11 for specifying a Coordinate Reference System (CRS). The GeoPackage standard uses the term Spatial Reference System instead of Coordinate Reference System. This is because GeoPackage standard was designed to be flexible and to be able to accommodate any reference system. As such, GeoPackage tables that deal with CRS us the "spatial_ref" literal as part of the table name.

include::requirements/REQ004.adoc[]

Please also note the definition of Volume 1 CDB Core Requirement 7 Units of Measure and Requirement 111 Vextex CRS for guidance on proper and compliant use of CRS in a CDB compliant GeoPackage.

==== GeoPackage Requirements Options - Features
The following requirement clarifies the GeoPackage requirements that shall be followed when implementing vector fectures in a GeoPackage. Please note that GeoPackage geometry and feature definitions are consistent with the OGC Simple Features model and ISO 19107.

include::requirements/REQ005.adoc[]

==== Requirement CDB Core - Need to discuss this one. Could be changed to a backend process and not a client.
The following requirement defines how vector data in a GeoPackage is to be structured based on requirements specified in the CDB Core document.

include::requirements/REQ006.adoc[]

=== CDB Requirements for a CDB compliant GeoPackage Vector encoding
This section documents the CDB requirements that need to be considered when implementing a CDB compliant GeoPackage for use in a CDB data store. This section also provides any clarifications and/or profiles of those requirements. The majority of the requirements referenced in this section are detailed in Volume 1: OGC CDB Core Standard: Model and Physical Data Store Structure (hereafter known as CDB Core). In the GeoPackage in CDB standard, requirements are specified that themselves reference specific requirements in the Core

==== CDB Vector Data Core Requirements
The following requirement profiles the CDB general data representation core requirements class: Requirements Class - General Data Representation (Requirements 6-10). Please note that the profile excludes the raster imagery compression requirement. The related CDB conformance class documented in Annex A of the CDB Core standard is A.1.1	General CDB Data Store and Implementation.

==== CDB Tiling and LoD Rules for Structuring GeoPackages
The following requirement references the CDB requirements for the rules for tiling the vector data in a GeoPackage and determination of the level of detail (LoD) in which the GeoPackage should be stored. Complete details for the CDB tiling and LoD storage model are found in CDB Volume 1 and clause "CDB Concepts".

include::requirements/REQ008.adoc[]

==== GeoPackage in CDB - Tiled Vector Data Sets
Clause 3.6 - Tiled Data Sets specifies the requirements and provides detailed supporting information on the tiling structure and LoD structure for tiled vector data. Note: All vector data sets are tiled in a CDB structured data store. The level-of-detail organization for GeoPackage vector datasets mimics the concept of map scaling commonly found in cartography. Please especially note Requirement 64 in the Core. Also pay careful attendtion to the tables and equations for calculating the latitude and longitude elements of the file names for the GeoPackages.

include::requirements/REQ009.adoc[]

==== CDB GeoPackage Vector Datasets

===== CDB Vector data general requirements
This clause references requirements in section 5.7 Vector Datasets in the Volume 1 CDB Core Model Standard. The OGC suggests that clause 5.7 of the Core CDB standard be read in its entirety prior to developing capabilities to transform any non-CDB data source into a CDB structured GeoPackage that meets the mandatory requirements and would pass the CDB compliance tests.

From Volume 1: _All of the information that is needed to instance features is organized in accordance to the CDB tile structure.  All the tiled Vector dataset files are located in the same directory. The datasetâ€™s second component selector (CS2) is used to differentiate between files with the same extension or with the same Vector features._

Further, the developer also needs to understand the feature coding system used in a CDB data store. From Volume 1: _The Vector dataset concept and the feature concepts overlap somewhat; some of the Vector datasets are generalizations or specializations of feature codes.  Section 1.5 CDB Data Dictionary provides a recommended mapping of the feature attributes across the CDB compliant datasets.  Note that the same feature should not have two representations._ More specifically, visit section 3.3.8.1 Feature Classification for more details. Basically, for the file path and naming requirements to be properly implemented, the correct feature codes need to be used. See http://schemas.opengis.net/cdb/1.1/Feature_Data_Dictionary.xml and http://schemas.opengis.net/cdb/1.1/Feature_Data_Dictionary.xsd for a complete list of feature codes. The .xml file is actually located in http://schemas.opengis.net/cdb/cdb-1_1_0.zip .

The first set of tiled vector data requirements relates to coordinates for lights and the structure of vertex coordinates.

===== CDB Attribution
Attributes are used to describe one or more real or virtual characteristics of a feature.  Features can be assigned a variable number of attributes. The following requirements from the core document and related informative discussion in Volume 1 Core describe the CDB compliant usage of attributes in a CDB datastore.
