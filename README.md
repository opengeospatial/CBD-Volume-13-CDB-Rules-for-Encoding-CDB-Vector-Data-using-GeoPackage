# Standard template

This GitHub repository contains the content for a draft GeoPackage extension for a CDB data store.

The repo is organized as follows:

* index.adoc - nothing in this document
* standard - the main standard document content
  - organized in multiple sections and directories
  - this is the only part needed to create a standard
