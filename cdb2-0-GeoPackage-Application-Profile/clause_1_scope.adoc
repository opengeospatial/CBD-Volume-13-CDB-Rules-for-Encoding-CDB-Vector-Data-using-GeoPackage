== Scope

This optional OGC CDB 2.0 Application Profile Extension the behavior and requirements for encoding vector and coverage data in a GeoPackage container for use in a CDB data store. The requirements and related guidance are grounded in the CDB 2.0 Fundamental Core Requirements Classes, CDB 1.3 Requirements for file naming and attribution, and the GeoPackage core requirements for vector data. As such, any GeoPackage that is to be referenced/used in a CDB data store must be 1.) compliant with the CDB 2.0 Fundamental Core requirements for coverage and vector data, 2.) compliant with CDB 1.3 Requirements as referenced, and 2.) compliant with the GeoPackage core requirements for encoding coverage and vector data.

Specifically this Standard references and restricts the following CDB 2.0 Fundamantal Core Requirements Classes.
